# Inside the World of Hackers- Myth vs. Reality

Hacking isn't about hoodies and green terminal screens. It's about curiosity, creativity, and code.

## Who is a Hacker?

A **hacker** is someone who explores and experiments with systems, software, and security—often to discover flaws or push boundaries. Contrary to popular belief, not all hackers are criminals.

Hackers are broadly categorized as:

- **White Hat** – Ethical hackers who help organizations stay secure.
- **Black Hat** – Malicious hackers who exploit systems for personal gain.
- **Gray Hat** – Operate in the moral grey area—exposing flaws without permission, but without malicious intent.

## Example: Ethical Hacking in Action

```javascript
// Simulated XSS vulnerability test in a web app
function simulateInput(userInput) {
  const safeOutput = userInput.replace(/</g, "&lt;").replace(/>/g, "&gt;");
  document.body.innerHTML = `<p>${safeOutput}</p>`;
}

simulateInput("<script>alert('Hacked!')</script>"); // Will not execute the script
