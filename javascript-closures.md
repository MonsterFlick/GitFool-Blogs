# Understanding JavaScript Closures _TEST

Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that every developer must understand.

## What is a Closure?

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).

## Example

```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
    return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {


}

const newFunction = outerFunction("outside");
newFunction("inside");
```

## Why Use Closures?

- **Data privacy**: Closures help in data hiding and encapsulation.
- **Factory functions**: Used to generate functions with preset configurations.
- **Callbacks and event handlers**: Widely used in asynchronous code patterns.

## Summary

Closures are one of the most powerful features of JavaScript. Understanding them will allow you to write better, more maintainable code.
