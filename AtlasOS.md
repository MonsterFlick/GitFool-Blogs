# Atlas OS: A Lightweight, Open-Source Windows Mod

**The Problem:** Windows has grown bloated, filled with background processes, ads, and telemetry.  
While itâ€™s widely used, it isnâ€™t exactly efficientâ€”especially for gamers and power users.

Thatâ€™s where **Atlas OS** comes in.  
A performance-focused, open-source mod of Windows that strips away the fluff and gives you back control.

## Why I Love Atlas OS

Atlas isnâ€™t a full replacement for Windowsâ€”itâ€™s a smarter, lighter version of it.  
It's perfect for users who want the familiarity of Windows without the clutter.

Hereâ€™s what makes it shine:

- **Debloated Core**  
  Atlas removes pre-installed apps, unnecessary services, and hidden background tasks. Less junk, more speed.

- **Performance Gains**  
  Idle RAM usage drops drastically, boot times improve, and FPS in games goes up significantly.

- **Privacy Respecting**  
  Most of Microsoft's tracking and telemetry is disabled. You decide what runs and what doesnâ€™t.

- **Open-Source Scripts**  
  Every tweak Atlas makes is open-source and auditable. Itâ€™s transparent and community-driven.

- **Easy to Set Up**  
  With the AME Wizard and clear docs, applying Atlas to a fresh Windows install is smooth and fast.

| **Pre-installed apps** | Loads of bloat       | All removed                      |
| **Updates**        | Frequent, sometimes forced| Minimal, security-only by default|
| **User Control**   | Limited                   | Highly customizable              |

## Things to Consider Before Switching to Atlas OS

Iâ€™ve been experimenting with Atlas OS, and itâ€™s incredibly fast.  
But here are a few things to note:

- Itâ€™s **not for beginners**â€”you need a clean Windows install and some basic tech skills.
- **Security features** like Defender or SmartScreen may be disabled for performance.
- Windows **updates are paused** to prevent undoing tweaksâ€”youâ€™ll need to manage this manually.
- Since itâ€™s a community project, **support is unofficial** (though the Discord is super active).
