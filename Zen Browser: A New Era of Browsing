## Why I Love ZEN

Zen Browser is built to enhance productivity and help you stay focused. Itâ€™s not just another browserâ€”itâ€™s a tool that supports your workflow.

Here are some features that truly stand out:

- **Workspaces**  
  Organize tabs into dedicated workspaces for each project. Itâ€™s a game-changer for multitaskers and creators.

- **Compact Mode**  
  A real full-screen experience that minimizes distractions and maximizes screen space. Super clean and immersive.

- **Glance**  
  Preview websites without fully opening themâ€”perfect for quick browsing and research.

- **Split View**  
  Read an article while watching your favorite YouTuber side-by-side. Itâ€™s multitasking made simple.

- The experience is quite different from traditional browsersâ€”it may take some getting used to.
- Zen is still in **beta**, so you might encounter the occasional bug or missing feature.
